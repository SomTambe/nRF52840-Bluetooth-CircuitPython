# nRF52840-Bluetooth-CircuitPython
Scripts for using BLE on the Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense board.
Inspired from Ali Shtarbanov's examples [here](https://github.com/shtarbanov/WebBluetooth-Feather-nRF52832).

For advertising, I use the [beacon](https://github.com/SomTambe/cpy-ble-beacons) modules I have developed.
